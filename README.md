I have been contributing to open source on and off through my adult life as a software developer. However, it seemed
all too easy to walk away from projects &mdash; even my own &mdash; when faced with the process hassle of those code
hosts (SourceForge, Google Code, Bitbucket, etc.).

I couldn't agree more! As a product, GitHub has fundamentally changed my open source activity. I expect this change
will stick with me for the rest of my life. From the quickness of repo setup, to the integrated and easy-to-use
issue tracker, to the amazing Pull Request mechanism, to the integration with Travis-CI through service hooks... 
GitHub's innovations in collaboration are always making it "easier for individuals and teams to write better code,
faster".<sup>\[[2][gh/about]\]</sup>

GitHub has really helped me take my development skills and open source life to the next level, and now I would like to
return the favor:  
**I want to work for GitHub, and I will do my best to ensure we continue to push the envelope!**

As amazing as GitHub already is, I am confident that I can help us achieve even more! I already have
[many new feature ideas, as well as a few bugs to fix][cover-letter/github-todo].


_**Still raw:**_  
 - I really want to fix them and I am passionate about what I do.
 - GitHub helps people build amazing software together.<sup>\[[2][gh/about]\]</sup>
 - In my opinion, GitHub has established itself as the currently uncontested "King of Code Hosts".
 - I love GitHub.
 - Come help us make collaboration even better. At GitHub we build the tools that make collaborating and writing software easier. <sup>\[[3][gh/jobs]\]</sup>
 - Regarding GITHUB-TODO.md:  
    > **@JamesMGreene**: I just keep adding to it [the GITHUB-TODO.md list]. Ironically, I came up with a handful of
    > them while experiencing trouble working on this repo, LOL.  
    > **@jonrohan**: It only gets worse (not in a bad way) when you work here... you see so much and want to fix it all!
    > With 100% freedom, and 100% passion, it's hard to confine yourself.  
    > **@JamesMGreene**: Totally understand!  


**Notes:**  
 - Elaborate on the skills I bring to the employer
