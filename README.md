**TL;DR:**  
 1. I love GitHub as a product, and I especially like these things about it
 2. Some other things can be fixed
 3. I really want to fix them and I am passionate about what I do


**Long Form:**  
GitHub helps people build amazing software together. With the collaborative features of GitHub, it has never been
easier for individuals and teams to write better code, faster.<sup>\[[1][gh/about]\]</sup> 

Come help us make collaboration even better.
At GitHub we build the tools that make collaborating and writing software easier.

**Regarding GITHUB-TODO.md:**  
> **@JamesMGreene**: I just keep adding to it [the GITHUB-TODO.md list]. Ironically, I came up with a handful of
> them while experiencing trouble working on this repo, LOL.  
> **@jonrohan**: It only gets worse (not in a bad way) when you work here... you see so much and want to fix it all!
> With 100% freedom, and 100% passion, it's hard to confine yourself.  
> **@JamesMGreene**: Totally understand!  


As [**@mikeal**][mikeal/gh] [blogged][mikeal/generation-gap]:
> Then GitHub happened. ...It turned out to be so disruptive that it created a cultural divide between the previous
> generation of open source and the next.

**Notes:**  
 1. Intro + top skills I bring to the table
 2. Elaborate on the skills I bring to the employer
 3. ...
 4. ...
 5. Provide additional contact information? Confidently request an interview.
