I have been contributing to open source on and off through my adult life as a software developer. However, it seemed
all too easy to walk away from projects &mdash; even my own &mdash; when faced with the process hassles of other code
hosts (SourceForge, Google Code, Bitbucket, etc.). 

> Then GitHub happened. ...It turned out to be so disruptive that it created a cultural divide between the previous
> generation of open source and the next.  
>  &nbsp; ~~ [**@mikeal**][mikeal/gh] <sup>\[[1][mikeal/generation-gap]\]</sup>

I couldn't agree more! As a product, GitHub has fundamentally changed my open source activity in a way that is sticking
with me when so many others did not. From the efficiency of repo setup, to the integrated and easy-to-use issue tracker,
to the amazing Pull Request mechanism, to the succinctness of GitHub-Flavored Markdown, to the integration with
Travis-CI through service hooks... GitHub's innovations in collaboration are always making it "easier for individuals
and teams to write better code, faster".<sup>\[[2][gh/about]\]</sup>

GitHub has really helped me take my development skills and open source life to the next level, and now I would like to
return the favor:  
**I want to work for GitHub, and I will do my best to ensure we continue to push the envelope!**

As amazing as GitHub already is, I am confident that I can help us achieve even more! I have already been [collecting
my ideas][cover-letter/github-todo] for quite a few new features, as well as noting a few bugs whose squashing
I'd like to see to personally. After I had created the initial draft of this list, I was so invigorated at the prospect of being a
part of the GitHub family that I couldn't stop myself from continuing to add more and more ideas to it.
Ironically, but perhaps not surprisingly, most of the bugs that I noted were found as a direct result of
putting this very "gh-cover-letter" repo together. As a believer in dogfooding (or "eating your own dog food"), this
seemed like the perfect experience to kick off what I hope will be the start of my career at GitHub!

GitHub helps people build amazing software together<sup>\[[2][gh/about]\]</sup> by creating the tools that make
collaborating and writing software easier.<sup>\[[3][gh/jobs]\]</sup> In doing so, I firmly believe that GitHub
has established itself as the uncontested "King of Code Hosts". Now, I want to help GitHub make collaboration
even better!

### Technical Prowess
 - I am a JavaScript language expert, for both the frontend (browsers) and back (Node.js, PhantomJS, etc.).
 - I am extremely proficient at [and well-versed in] learning new programming languages and frameworks.
 - I am a practitioner of unit testing, though I know from experience that it doesn't always pan out as well we hope.
 - I am a regular GitHub.com user but I accomplish most of my Git interactions from the terminal.
 - I am extraordinarily detail-oriented.


### Personality
 - I am an easy-going person and enjoy working with others, though I have also been an "individual contributor" for
   much of my professional career.
 - I refuse to stop [learning][cover-letter/learning], and I strive to find a healthy balance between the breadth and depth
of the knowledge that I absorb.
 - I am very passionate about creating _and shipping_ high quality software; a desire which is complimented well by my
detail-oriented nature.
 - I am _obsessed_ with the three Cs of open source: [creating, contributing, and consuming][cover-letter/open-source].
 - I have an unabashed love for JavaScript that most engineers consider unhealthy.
 - Oh, and &mdash; in case you couldn't tell &mdash; I am already crazy about GitHub. :heart_eyes:
